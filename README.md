# Project Overview
Last project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in [Udacity](https://udacity.com): 
in this project I had to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 


## How to run the application ##
Download the repository in your desktop, unzip it and open the "index.html" file in your browser to play the game.

## How to check the tests?
Scroll down the page to the jasmine section. Here, you should see the specs tested and whether they pass or not.
